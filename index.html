                <h2>My Favorite Self Portrait</h2>
                <img src="1resize.jpg" alt="Self Portrait Taken in Front of My Window" />
                <p>This is a self portrait I took at the beginning of 2020. I normally like to live behind the camera, but on this day, I wanted to push myself to play both roles. I also wanted to experiment with my editing style by working in black and white, since my photos are usually very vibrant. Overall, this is still my favorite self portrait to date!</p>

                <h2>My Favorite Landscape Photo</h2>
                <img src="IMG_2560re2.jpg" alt="Family Near Morro Rock" />
                <p>I took this photo in Morro Bay in November of 2019 while I was on Thanksgiving Break. I wasn't planning to take my camera to the beach on this day, but I'm very glad I did. This is one my favorite photos I've ever taken because of how all the different aspects in it balance. I love the combination of the colors, the detail, and the juxtaposition between the large Morro Rock and the family on the left.</p>
